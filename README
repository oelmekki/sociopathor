# What ?

Sociopathor is a rails engine that bundle ready to use implementation of authlogic
and authlogic-connect, to register / login on your app with facebook and twitter.
Once installed, the only thing you need to do is to give your api keys and secrets.

I created it in order not to have to recode this each times, so I only put in the
services I needed (twitter and facebook) among the large panel of services supported
by authlogic.

If you need more sociopathy, well, fork it.


# Install

In your Gemfile, put :
  gem 'sociopathor', :git => 'git://github.com/oelmekki/sociopathor.git'

Then run :
  bundle install
  rails generate sociopathor:install
  rake db:migrate


# Config

Sociopathor use authlogic-connect, and should be configured as that one.
Two files will be installed :
  config/authlogic.yml
  config/initializers/authlogic_connect_config.rb

Enter your api key / secrets in both.
