# What ?

Sociopathor is a rails engine that bundle ready to use implementation of authlogic
and authlogic-connect, to register / login on your app with facebook and twitter.
Once installed, the only thing you need to do is to give your api keys and secrets.

I created it in order not to have to recode this each times, so I only put in the
services I needed (twitter and facebook) among the large panel of services supported
by authlogic.

If you need more sociopathy, well, fork it.


# Install

In your Gemfile, put :
  gem 'sociopathor', :git => 'git://github.com/oelmekki/sociopathor.git'

Then run :
  bundle install
  rails generate sociopathor:install
  rake db:migrate


# Config

Sociopathor use authlogic-connect, and should be configured as that one.
Two files will be installed :
  config/authlogic.yml
  config/initializers/authlogic_connect_config.rb

Enter your api key / secrets in both.


# Extend

You'll probably want to extend the base classes. Sociopathor being a rails engine, you
can't just monkey patch them : if an app/models/user.rb file exists in your app, the
engine's one won't be loaded.

That's ok, this mechanism let you override views. Sociopathor generator installs a
bunch of files for you to extend its base class :
  app/models/local_user.rb
  app/models/local_user_session.rb
  app/controllers/local_users_controller.rb
  app/controllers/local_user_sessions_controller.rb

If you don't need them, you can safely erase them.
